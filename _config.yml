  about_you: I build things - mostly software, sometimes systems. Iâ€™ve been a programmer, a PM, and a founder, depending on what needed to get built. Usually found working through one of the many unread books on my shelf. Occasionally, I write - some of it is <a href="https://haecceity.substack.com/">here</a>.
